**SmartCash AI** is a high-performance treasury orchestration engine designed for global enterprises. By bridging the gap between **SWIFT ISO 20022 bank feeds** and **SAP S/4HANA ERP systems**, the platform achieves a **94.2% Straight-Through Processing (STP) rate**, transforming Accounts Receivable from a cost center into a strategic liquidity asset.

## 💎 Institutional Value Proposition (PM Lens)
Traditional Accounts Receivable (AR) suffers from "The Remittance Gap" - unstructured data leading to unapplied cash. SmartCash AI solves this via:

1. **Liquidity Velocity:** Automated reconciliation of multi-currency payments using weighted fuzzy heuristics.
2. **ESG-Linked Governance:** Integration of sustainability scoring into the AR subledger to mitigate counterparty risk.
3. **Cognitive Exception Handling:** GenAI agents that resolve "Short-Pays" by drafting professional dispute communications automatically.
